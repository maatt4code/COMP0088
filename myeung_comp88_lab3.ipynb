These models have losses that are not smooth and aren't suited to simple gradient-based optimisation. You are only asked to produce naïve, brute force implementations of these models, but do note that such implementations can scale really badly, so be cautious about running the algorithms with large sample sizes. You may find it interesting to think about what strategies could be used to speed things up.\n",

        "Decision trees are both a learning model in their own right and an important constituent model for the ensemble methods in subsequent tasks. The model consists of a recursive sequence of binary tests, typically of inequalities on single feature values. These effectively partition the feature space into separate regions, each of which is then assigned the class that occurs most often among training samples within it.(Equivalently, those training samples *vote* on the outcome. Once again, the `utils.vote` function may be useful here.)\n",

        "AdaBoost is a meta-algorithm that iteratively builds an ensemble of weak learners such that each new addition provides the best available marginal improvement in the ensemble performance. The new learner is chosen to minimise its weighted classification error on the training set, with the sample weights updated at each iteration to prioritise misclassified points. The training procedure is shown in pseudocode form below:\n",

        "  * fit classifier $h_t$ to minimise misclassification error with weights $w_i$\n",
        "  * set $\\epsilon =$ the weighted misclassification error of $h_t$\n",
        "  * compute prediction weight: $\\alpha_t = \\log\\big(\\frac{1-\\epsilon}{\\epsilon}\\big)$\n",
        "  * update weights: $w_i \\leftarrow w_i \\exp(\\alpha_t \\mathbb{1}(y_i \\neq h_i(x_i)))$\n",
        "  * normalise weights: $w_i = \\frac{w_i}{\\sum_j w_j}$\n",

        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that the training algorithm has been expressed in terms that don't require a particular binary labelling convention, but the prediction expression above assumes that the outputs of the classifiers $h_t$ are $\\{-1, 1\\}$. This is *not* the case for the decision trees implemented in Task 2, nor for the synthetic data. So you will need to convert the $h_t$ outputs appropriately within the prediction sum.\n",
        "\n",
        "AdaBoost is agnostic as to the class of weak learners used, but is commonly implemented using **decision stumps** — decision trees of depth 1 — and that is what you should do here, using the decision tree functions you implemented in Task 2."

        "For practical applications, you will almost never need to implement classic ML models like decision trees and random forests yourself. Instead, you will typically use existing implementations such as those in the [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) library. Because they are so widely used, these are likely to be more versatile, better optimised and better tested than your own code.\n",
        "\n",
        "`scikit-learn` supports a wide range of ML models and algorithms, including all those in the lab exercises above: [nearest neighbours](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html#nearest-neighbors-classification), [decision trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html), [AdaBoost](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#adaboost) and [forests of randomised trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#forests-of-randomized-trees). Models have (mostly) consistent interfaces for training and evaluation, so it is usually straightforward to swap between different models and compare their behaviour.\n",

        "We will see a bit more of this library in future weeks, but by all means get acquainted with it now if you have the time and inclination."
